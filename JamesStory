So the story starts in a place beyond the trappings of technology, in a land rich in
in magic to render most manmade contraptions obsolete. In the land we have a young 
man named Rodgrez attempt to find his way through the coming of age ceramony 
expected of all the men in this civilization. 

However, Rodrez has always been facinated with the rational behind the magic. 
While others would look for different means to harness the archane, such as the
elements, for their own benifit. This young man was more interested in the 
magic behind the magic.Tthe suble breeze over the ocean tide, the lighting in the storm, and
how the fires burned only when there was the invisible air around them.

As such, the coming of age ceromony, which happened to always involve testing the
combat aplitude of the magi, held no place in the heart of the young mage. While his
peers were eagerly anticipating the upcoming ceromony, Rodgrez was focused on more
on the documentation of the classifactions of magics instead of the application.
